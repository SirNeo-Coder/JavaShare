# Session inactivity verification — 2026-10-20

Branch: `codex/session-inactivity`, based on `codex/production-module-setup` (PR #23,
which contains documentation only). No hosted setting or deployment was changed.

## Final required checks

- `npm run build:all`: passed, production Next.js plus backend TypeScript.
- `npm run lint`: passed with 0 errors and 8 existing warnings (images/live-effect dependencies).
- `sg docker -c 'npm test -- --test-reporter=spec'`: 140 passed, 0 failed, 0 cancelled, 0 skipped.
- `sg docker -c 'npm run classroom:offline -- --check'`: local Supabase running, offline configuration ready.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

## Isolated checks and regression proof

`session-expiry.test.mjs` calls the real shared HTTP handlers with signed disposable
test tokens and a controlled clock. It checks student/teacher boundaries, five-hour
absence, rejected classroom access and renewal after expiry, background non-renewal,
legacy/forged tokens, renewal validation, cookie flags, absolute maximum and live passes.
These do not require a database; the full suite additionally exercises local Supabase.

`session-activity.test.mjs` uses browser-event/storage mocks and a controlled clock.
It checks trusted gestures, per-minute throttling, exact last-gesture time, delayed timers,
warning/continue, suspension, shared tabs, account changes, cleanup, renewal failure and 401s.
These are rule/controller checks, not a replacement for the actual app checks below.

Temporarily removing the server's inactivity comparison made the server regression fail.
Temporarily skipping the browser expiry action made its assertions fail. Restored both;
the focused tests passed, then the full final suite above passed. The first attempted
browser mutation disabled its entire deadline branch and caused a zero-delay timer loop;
that temporary test was stopped, source restored, and the narrower mutation above
produced the intended assertion failures. No mutation remains in the source.

## Actual production app and browser

Production app at `127.0.0.1:3006`, local Supabase only, disposable teacher/student
accounts and class removed afterward. Used installed Chromium through Playwright;
long idle waits were advanced with the browser test clock, not waited out in real time.

- teacher: UI login role limit 120 minutes; classroom opened; trusted input renewed; one-minute warning; timer logout cleared server cookie; open Student accounts tab also signed out; no page errors.
- student: UI login role limit 15 minutes; classroom opened; trusted input renewed; one-minute warning; timer logout cleared server cookie; no page errors.
- Restored browser fixture: five-hour-old signed idle deadline required Sign in and classroom request returned 401.
- Offline production app: authenticated laptop javac run printed Idle offline check.

Visually inspected the student warning and signed-out page screenshots. Local ignored
artifacts: `outputs/session-inactivity/teacher-warning.png`, `teacher-signed-out.png`,
`student-warning.png`, `student-signed-out.png`, `browser.txt` and regression logs.
The expired restored-session fixture sends a still-signed token with an old inactivity
deadline; it does not simulate a physical laptop shutdown.

## Failures, compatibility and untested areas

- Initial production type check caught an insufficiently narrowed session value; corrected
  it and rebuilt successfully. Initial browser automation needed the installed Chromium
  path, earlier clock installation and a precise alert selector; final real-app checks passed.
- No final test failures, cancellations or skips. Eight pre-existing lint warnings remain.
- No hosted deployment/production re-test, Brave-specific test, physical laptop sleep,
  disconnected-internet test, or separate classroom-Wi-Fi device test was performed.
- Existing seven-day cookies without an inactivity deadline require a fresh sign-in on rollout.
  Current sessions keep a seven-day maximum across activity renewals. No migration is needed.
- Saved work remains intact. Automatic sign-out can discard unsaved edits after the
  one-minute save/continue warning; drafts are not stored on public computers by this change.
- Browser activity reports are ordinary session keep-alives, not proof a human is present.
  The server refuses renewal after the signed idle deadline. Existing stateless logout does
  not centrally revoke a copied token before its signed expiry; no new session database is introduced.
