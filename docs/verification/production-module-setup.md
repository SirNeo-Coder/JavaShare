# Production module repair verification — 2026-10-20

Branch: `codex/production-module-setup`. Documentation and a temporary convenience
SQL file only; application code and existing migrations were not changed.

## Results and limits

- `npm run build:all`: passed (Next.js pages and backend TypeScript).
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 8 existing warnings.
- `sg docker -c 'npm test'`: **125 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `npm run kb:search -- 'production students missing module tables'`: CKB-050 first.
- Initial `node --test tests/kb-search.test.mjs` in the restricted environment
  reported a test-file failure without individual test output. Both named checks
  passed in the subsequent complete suite run outside that restriction. The
  initial Docker attempts were also restricted; the authorized local check passed.

## Local SQL proof

Command: `python3 /tmp/codeshare-module-sql-check.py` (temporary check, not an
application script). It used Docker's existing local PostgreSQL container and a
new disposable database, removed in `finally`. The pre-existing classroom database
was not reset or migrated by this check. The temporary prerequisite schema used
the existing migration definitions for profiles, classrooms and set_updated_at,
with a minimal auth.users table, a test teacher and a test class.

- PASS: readiness check detects all seven missing requirements before repair.
- PASS: unchanged six-migration bundle restores all seven requirements.
- PASS: existing teacher/class retained, new storage empty, obsolete field removed,
  and row-level security enabled on both module tables.
- PASS: disposable local test database removed.

The delivered `/tmp/codeshare-module-setup.sql` is an ordered concatenation of the
six existing `20261018` migrations, with source labels and one-time-use instructions.
An inline Python assertion checked that all six source texts occur unchanged.
The readiness SQL was extracted from the teacher guide and used both before and
after applying this bundle. This demonstrates detection of the missing schema
and the repaired local state; production failing-before/passing-after proof is
still pending. No production exception details, hosted SQL execution, hosted
browser restoration, real student data or remote keys were accessed.

## Coverage types

The SQL check tests the database setup directly. Existing Supabase-backed route
tests exercise the real shared application handlers against disposable local data;
they do not visit the production browser. UI/schema/helper checks test rendering
or rules in isolation. No new application path was introduced. No offline browser
session was repeated because the change contains only documentation and uses the
existing migrations unchanged. The required teacher-run production checks are in
[the repair guide](../production-module-setup.md).

The first run on the starting branch passed 98/98. The documentation was then
rebased onto current main to preserve newer work and assign the next unused case
number, CKB-050. The final build, lint and 125-test suite were rerun on that base.
All six migration source files are identical across those bases.

## Named tests, grouped by file

Command for every group: `sg docker -c 'npm test'`.

### `tests/api-router.test.mjs`

- ✔ router: path parameters, query, cookies, and JSON body reach the handler
- ✔ router: middleware passes on with next(), stops by responding, and next(error) reaches the error handler
- ✔ router: cookies, 204, unknown routes, bad JSON, and size limits
- ✔ router: the larger JSON body cap is scoped to the module-upload route, not every route
- ✔ routes: register, stay signed in with the cookie, get a live pass, sign out

- ✔ module activities: offline ignores online runner address and refuses browser progress

### `tests/module-availability.test.mjs`

- ✔ module availability: unknown modules and step ids cannot create progress (CKB-018)
